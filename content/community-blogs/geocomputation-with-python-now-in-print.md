<p><em>&#8220;Geocomputation with Python&#8221;</em> (or <em>geocompy</em> for short) covers the entire range of standard GIS operations <strong>for both vector and raster data </strong>models. Each section and chapter builds on the previous. If youâ€™re just starting out with Python to work with geographic data, we hope that the book will be an excellent place to start.</p>



<p>Of course, you can still find the <strong>online version</strong> of the book at <a href="https://py.geocompx.org/">py.geocompx.org</a>. </p>



<p>The book is open-source and you can find the <strong>code</strong> on <a href="https://github.com/geocompx/geocompy">GitHub</a>. This ensures that the content is reproducible, transparent, and accessible. It also lets you interact with the project by opening issues and submitting pull requests.</p>
