<p>You can now make a field <em>read-only</em> dynamically using QGIS expressions! This feature is available in QGIS 3.30 and newer. To set it up, go to <em>Layer Properties â†’ Attributes Form</em>, select a field, and change the <em>editable</em> flag to an expression that returns <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. This allows you to control when a field is locked for editing based on your data or conditions.</p>
