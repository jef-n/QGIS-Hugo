<p>We are thrilled to announce that QGIS has been officially recognized as a <strong>Digital Public Good (DPG)</strong> by the <strong>Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA)</strong>! This recognition underscores our commitment to open-source geospatial solutions that contribute to the advancement of the <strong>United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">What is a Digital Public Good?</h3>



<p>A Digital Public Good is a digital solution that meets the <strong>DPG Standard</strong>, ensuring that it is open-source, respects privacy, adheres to best practices, and contributes to sustainable development. The DPGA is a multi-stakeholder initiative dedicated to fostering the discovery, development, and implementation of digital solutions that address global challenges such as climate change, public health, and equitable access to technology.</p>
